#### **Learning Graph Filters for Structure–Function Coupling Based Hub Node Identification**  
**Co-first author** · Published in IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks (TSIPN) 2025  
**Ortiz-Bouza, M.<sup>*</sup>, Vu, D.<sup>*</sup>, Karaaslanli, A., & Aviyente, S. (2025)**  
[DOI:10.1109/TSIPN.2025.3595070](https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2025.3595070)  
- Co-first author journal publication in IEEE TSIPN.  
- Developed a learning-based polynomial graph filter framework to detect functionally consistent connector hub nodes in fMRI and DWI data, using Glasser atlas parcellation for higher resolution.  
- Showed that connector hubs play a central role in brain function and information flow, with results consistent with prior meta-studies.  
- Validated the framework on simulated networks and Human Connectome Project data, demonstrating high global efficiency.  
- Built a Linux pipeline for connectome construction, generated results, and co-wrote the manuscript.

#### **Graph Filtering for Hub Node Identification in Brain Networks**  
**First author** · Published at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2024  
**Vu, D., Ortiz-Bouza, M., & Aviyente, S. (2024)**  
[DOI:10.1109/ISBI56570.2024.10635215](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI56570.2024.10635215)  
- Introduced a graph filtering method for hub node detection in EEG-derived brain signals.  
- Framework validated against One-Class SVM and Eigenvector Centrality, showing temporal significance with respect to error-related negativity tasks.  
- Implemented the framework in Python, compiled experimental results, and analyzed their neuroscientific implications.  
- First author paper presented at IEEE ISBI 2024 in Athens, Greece.
