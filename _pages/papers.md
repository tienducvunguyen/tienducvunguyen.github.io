### **VergeIO: Depth-Aware Eye Interaction on Glasses**

<p><strong>Zhang, X.<sup>*</sup>, Vu, D.<sup>*</sup>, Shen, C., Wang, Y., Shi, Y., Chan, J. (2025)</strong></p>
<p><em>Submitted to ACM/IEEE SenSys 2026</em> · <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02187">arXiv:2507.02187</a></p>

- Developed a motion artifact detection system; conducted false-positive analysis and proposed preamble gestures (e.g., eyebrow raise) and adaptive filtering for noise suppression.  
- Co-wrote the manuscript and created the majority of the figures for analysis and publication.  
- Led power consumption profiling using the Monsoon Power Monitor and conducted latency measurements with the Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.  
- Designed and assembled hardware prototypes like auto-adjustable glasses and stereoscopic displays to propose real-world applications.

### **Hypergraph Overlapping Community Detection for Brain Networks**

<p><strong>Vu, D., & Aviyente, S. (2025)</strong></p>
<p><em>Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025</em> · <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08999">arXiv:2507.08999</a></p>

- Proposed a hypergraph-based overlapping community detection method for fMRI-derived brain networks.  
- Suggested validating detected communities by aligning with known ICA-derived networks and assessing consistency through randomized network scoring.  
- Led the project from idea to experimentation and result generation.  
- Coordinated research direction and wrote the majority of the manuscript.

### **Learning Graph Filters for Structure–Function Coupling Based Hub Node Identification**

<p><strong>Ortiz-Bouza, M.<sup>*</sup>, Vu, D.<sup>*</sup>, Karaaslanli, A., & Aviyente, S. (2025)</strong></p>
<p><em>Published in IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks (TSIPN)</em> · <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TSIPN.2025.3595070">DOI:10.1109/TSIPN.2025.3595070</a></p>

- Processed fMRI and DWI data from 122 subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP), downloaded via AWS S3 and used FreeSurfer with MRtrix3 to construct both structural connectomes and fMRI time-series signals.  
- Implemented and evaluated a learning-based graph filter framework alongside conventional machine learning models to generate hub node results.  
- Proposed a novel hyperparameter selection strategy based on cross-method result consistency and hub node validation using global efficiency.  
- Parcellated connectomes to the 360-region Glasser atlas and mapped results to Yeo functional networks; performed consistency validation via entropy-based metrics.  
- Co-wrote the manuscript and contributed to the design, analysis, and presentation of results.

### **Graph Filtering for Hub Node Identification in Brain Networks**

<p><strong>Vu, D., Ortiz-Bouza, M., & Aviyente, S. (2024)</strong></p>
<p><em>Published at IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</em> · <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ISBI56570.2024.10635215">DOI:10.1109/ISBI56570.2024.10635215</a></p>

- Adapted and optimized a learnable graph filter framework in MATLAB for application on EEG-derived brain networks.  
- Applied the framework and conventional algorithms such as One-Class SVM and Eigenvector Centrality to EEG data from 20 patients, generating comparative results.  
- Proposed a validation strategy using the percentage of hub nodes in each region and analyzing temporal significance of hub node activity.
