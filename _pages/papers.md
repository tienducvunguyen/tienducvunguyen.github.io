### 🧠 Research Projects & Publications

#### **VergeIO: Depth-Aware Eye Interaction on Glasses**  
**Co-primary author** · Submitted to ACM/IEEE SenSys 2026  
**Zhang, X.<sup>*</sup>, Vu, D.<sup>*</sup>, Shen, C., Wang, Y., Shi, Y., Chan, J. (2025)**  
[arXiv:2507.02187](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02187)  
- Developed VergeIO, the first EOG-based smart glasses enabling depth-aware interaction through optimized electrode layout and a novel hardware prototype.  
- Built motion artifact detection, conducted a user study with 11 participants, and validated applications for auto-focus glasses, AR alignment, and driver safety.

#### **Hypergraph Overlapping Community Detection for Brain Networks**  
**First author** · Accepted at IEEE MLSP 2025  
**Vu, D., & Aviyente, S. (2025)**  
[arXiv:2507.08999](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08999)  
- Introduced a hypergraph-based overlapping community detection method using line graphs and fMRI data.  
- Communities show strong subject consistency and align with known brain functional regions.

#### **Learning Graph Filters for Structure–Function Coupling Based Hub Node Identification**  
**Co-first author** · Submitted to IEEE T-SIPN Special Issue  
**Ortiz-Bouza, M.<sup>*</sup>, Vu, D.<sup>*</sup>, Karaaslanli, A., & Aviyente, S. (2024)**  
[arXiv:2410.17410](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17410)  
- Proposed an unsupervised polynomial graph filter to identify hub nodes with strong structure-function coupling.  
- Developed data pipelines, ran experiments, and presented results at Mid-SURE 2024.
