- **Hypergraph Overlapping Community Detection for Brain Networks**  
  *D. Vu, S. Aviyente (2025)*  
  Proposed hypergraph-based overlapping community detection method for brain networks from fMRI data.  
  [arXiv:2507.08999](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08999)

- **Learning Graph Filters for Structureâ€“Function Coupling Based Hub Node Identification**  
  *M. Ortiz-Bouza<sup></sup>, D. Vu<sup></sup>, A. Karaaslanli, S. Aviyente (2024)*  
  Developed an unsupervised graph filter method to identify hub nodes with strong structure-function coupling.
