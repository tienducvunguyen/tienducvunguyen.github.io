Hi! I'm Duc Vu, an undergraduate researcher at Michigan State University.  
My work focuses on:

- Graph signal processing and hypergraphs
- Brain networks and physiological signal modeling
- Real-time biomedical sensing systems

### Hobbies

**Soccer**  
Although I only began playing soccer in college, it has since become one of my main passion. I find myself deeply engaged with the sportâ€”not just in playing it, but also in following professional leagues like the Premier League.

**Drawing**  
I enjoy drawing, particularly portraits. My early sketches were more stylizedâ€”drawing inspiration from animation and medieval themes but recently Iâ€™ve been focusing on improving my fundamentals, such as form and anatomy, in order to improve my portrait drawings. Interestingly enough, people have told me I am very intense while drawing.

  <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(2)"></span> 
  <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span> 
  <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(4)"></span> 
</div>


**Gaming**  
Video games are my long-time interest, and Iâ€™ve enjoyed both multiplayer titles like *Counter-Strike* and *Dark Souls*, as well as more narrative-driven single-player games. Lately, Iâ€™ve grown especially interested in atmospheric games like *Bloodborne*, *Frostpunk*, *Resident Evil 7*, and *Clair Obscur: Expedition 33*. I find myself constantly listening to these games soundtracks on repeat. 

**Neuroscience & Signal Processing**  
One of my deeper intellectual hobbies is exploring the intersection of neuroscience and signal processing. Iâ€™m truly intrigued by how the brain, a complex biological system, can be studied through mathematical frameworks like graph theory and signal filtering. I find beauty in viewing the brain as a highly sophisticated learning and communication system, full of nonlinearities and quirks.
